                   Our group has the unique opportunity to be using our own design project as a prototype for the implementation phase. When we designed Tunecast we envisioned it as an iOS application.
                </p>
                <p>
                   However, we’ve decided that our implementation for this phase would be better as a web application.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Luckily, we lose very little functionality by converting our Tunecast prototype to a web app. Of course, our goal would be for the Tunecast software to be a mobile experience and we implemented with that in mind.

                <h1 id="implementation">Implementation Design Choices</h1>
                <h5>Our Choices</h5>
                <p>
                    Since we have limited time to design this app, we have had to simulate some functionality. Our biggest hurdle is integrating Spotify within Tunecast. Since Spotify requires an application to use its API we could not add those features. That being said, our web app will still be able to simulate a Spotify-like login and music playback experience (albeit using static music tracks).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have also had to tweak our design language for Tunecast in the conversion to a web app. Since we will not be able to accurately recreate iOS-specific UI elements, we have had to make some alternate choices.
                </p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>
					We had to simulate iOS page transitions with HTML and CSS
				</li>
				<li>
					We had to download the iOS font (San Francisco) to mimic mobile text
				</li>
				<li>
					We used static images to mimic the iOS interface (the status bar and menu bar icons)
				</li>
				</ul>
                <h5>Interface Decisions</h5>
                <p>
                    The primary goal of our interface is to be as minimal and clear as possible. There should be nothing superfluous. For our text, we imported the iOS font into our HTML implementation because of its sleek and unobtrusive design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided that the outline of the “like” and “dislike” heart buttons would change colour when pressed to give feedback to the user. We chose to just change the colour of the line rather than filling it in because it looked better alongside the other music player buttons.
                </p>

            <div class="one column">

                <h1 id="requirements">How Did We Meet Our Requirements?</h1>
                <h5>Requirement 1</h5>
                <p>
                    <b>The app needs to select the appropriate music based on the current season/weather/time of day. </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our core idea for Tunecast was to make an app that has an adaptive colour pallette based on the current weather conditions; this also translates to having the correct music for the weather as well.
                </p>
                <h5>Requirement 2</h5>
                <p>
                    <b>The app needs to curate music based on which particular genres or artists the user enjoys which is based off of the user’s Spotify history.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we are simulating the Spotify functionality, we have chosen certain tracks to showcase our vision for a full implementation of the smart playlists.
                </p>
                <h5>Requirement 3</h5>
                <p>
                    <b>The user interface for displaying the song and changing the song needs to have large and accessible buttons. </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we aren’t able to use iOS type icons, we have kept our original layout from our design phase. It was important to still have the option to like and dislike songs based on the user’s preferences. So, we still have our basic music functions with heart and broken-heart icons.
                </p>
                <h5>Requirement 4</h5>
                <p>
                    <b>The app will need to gather information from the user’s phone.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re able to simulate this functionality by showing a fictitious set of weather conditions and locations.

                <p>
                    In order to create a high fidelity prototype in a web version instead of mobile OS, we decided to develop it using GitHub’s Atom to code the prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Atom is an open source, extremely customisable editor that can be used across different platforms (enabling anyone to use it); it is also hackable, easy to navigate, and offers auto-completion which helps to optimize and speed up coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We implemented it as a text editor in order to combine our four languages of choice (CSS, HTML, Javascript and JQuery) which are used for our version of Tunecast to create a basic view, model, and control. In more detail, we used HTML to create the webpage and the base for the prototype, while CSS, Javascript and JQuery were used to create the functioning Tunecast prototype.
